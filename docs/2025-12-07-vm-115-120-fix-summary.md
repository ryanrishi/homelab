# VM 115 and 120 Fix Summary (2025-12-07)

## Context
Followed the remediation pattern from `vm-114-fix-summary.md` while honoring the updated requirement to use DHCP (no static IPs) for VMs 114/115/120. VMs 108 and 116 were used as references only and not modified.

## VM 115 (k3s-server-2)
- Status before: EFI and storage mapped correctly to LVM; networking not configured inside guest (no IPv4 reported by agent).
- Changes applied:
  - `qm set 115 -ipconfig0 ip=dhcp`
  - `qm cloudinit update 115`
  - `qm reboot 115`
- Validation:
  - `qm agent 115 network-get-interfaces` shows DHCP IPv4: `192.168.4.34` on `eth0`.

## VM 120 (k3s-replica-0)
- Status before: `scsi0` pointed to file-backed disk `local:120/vm-120-disk-1.raw` while LVM volume existed at `/dev/pve/vm-120-disk-0`; EFI present; networking not explicitly configured.
- Changes applied:
  - Stop to allow boot disk remap (implicit during operation).
  - `qm set 120 -scsi0 /dev/pve/vm-120-disk-0,size=20G`
  - `qm set 120 -ipconfig0 ip=dhcp`
  - `qm cloudinit update 120`
  - `qm start 120`
- Validation:
  - `qm agent 120 network-get-interfaces` shows DHCP IPv4: `192.168.4.128` on `eth0`.

## VM 114 (k3s-server-1) — DHCP Update
- Status before: Static IP configured via cloud-init (`192.168.4.219`). Storage and EFI correct.
- Changes applied:
  - `qm set 114 -ipconfig0 ip=dhcp`
  - `qm cloudinit update 114`
  - `qm reboot 114`
- Validation:
  - `qm agent 114 network-get-interfaces` shows IPv4 via DHCP. Current lease observed: `192.168.4.219` (likely DHCP reservation).

## Notes
- Guest agent interactions used `qm agent ...` methods. When executing commands inside guests, prefer full paths (e.g., `/usr/bin/cat`) due to PATH limitations.
- No changes were made to VMs 108 or 116.

## Result
- VM 115: Fully functional on DHCP; guest agent responsive.
- VM 120: Storage corrected to LVM boot disk and running on DHCP; guest agent responsive.
- VM 114: Switched to DHCP and verified; guest agent responsive.
