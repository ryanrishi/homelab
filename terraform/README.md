Terraform + Proxmox + cloud-init = ðŸ¤Œ
===

In v1 of my homelab, I created a template VM by booting a Debian image, very carefully doing some manual steps like creating users, setting up disk and swap, installing base packages, etc. I would then clone that template, do more manual steps like adding reconfiguring the timezone, adding SSH keys, regenerating the VM's ssh keys, and setting the hostname.

It's been a long-term goal of mine to move away from this manual and fragile process and leverage modern tooling. I debated moving these steps to Ansible, but I would still have had to set up users and ssh keys, so I ultimately landed on using cloud-init.

This directory holds Terraform cloud for rendering cloud-init templates and creating virtual machines based on those cloud-init configuration files.

Before using this, there needs to be a Proxmox user that has adequate permissions. I followed [this guide](https://austinsnerdythings.com/2021/09/01/how-to-deploy-vms-in-proxmox-with-terraform/) to create the user.

# Usage
1. Copy the example files to their expected location. Be sure to replace the real values with the user credentials created above.
    ```sh
    $ cp env.example .env
    $ cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```
2. Modify `main.tf` to suit your needs. You may also need to pass in `users` to the module since I've defaulted it to my needs in `modules/cloud_init/vars.tf`. You may also want to modify `cloud-init.tfpl` if you want to customize your cloud-init configuration.
3. Initialize Terraform
    ```sh
    $ tf init
    ```
4. Apply Terraform
    ```sh
    $ tf apply
    ```
    You should see Terraform at work and eventually a prompt asking "Do you want to perform these actions?". Enter `yes` if you want to do so, and watch Terraform create virtual machines that use cloud-init!
